# Locus Recommendation Ranker

As a science fiction fan, I read science fiction. As an adult, 
I don't have enough time to read, and I only have time to really read
five to ten books a year.

This is a quick script to format a CnP of the Locus Recommended reading 
for the year, and pull the users score from Good Reads, and rank them.
